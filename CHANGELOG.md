<!--
  Release process: before tagging v<x.y.z>, rename the "Unreleased" heading
  below to "## [<x.y.z>] - <YYYY-MM-DD>". The release workflow extracts the
  section whose heading matches the pushed tag and uses it as the GitHub
  release body. If no matching section exists, the release fails.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed
- Low-light vision no longer widens the area in which a *daylight*-style light cancels a
  darkness. Cancellation now uses the light's configured radius directly.
- A light **inside** a darkness/*daylight* cancellation overlap is no longer incorrectly suppressed.
- The cancelled segment of *daylight* no longer adds its step increase to another light's in the overlap.
- Removed the "ready — vertical slice" console error printed on startup.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- Beta release.
